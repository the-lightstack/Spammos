# Spammos
For Spamming bad domains with *seemingly* random users


## Why did I create this?
A friend of mine shared a link that seemed to just rickroll you, but -- as he told me -- collected the visitors ip addresses. 
So to fulfill my duties and protect all the other folks about the visit the link I wrote this short program that would hide the real IP's amongst many fake ones
so his data would be worthless.

## Why isn't it working?
You have to install TOR for this program to work at all because that's how we get changing client ip's.
